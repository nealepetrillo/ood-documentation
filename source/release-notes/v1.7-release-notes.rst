Upgrading from v1.6
-------------------

.. warning::

  If upgrading from OnDemand 1.3.x or older you must upgrade to 1.6.x before upgrading to 1.7.

.. warning::

  As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of OnDemand installed at your center first before you modify the *production* instance.

.. warning::

  Because of a change in Passenger versions and Ruby versions it is necessary that all PUNs running before the upgrade be restarted after the upgrade. It's recommended to schedule an short outage of your OnDemand instance to perform this upgrade.

#. Update OnDemand release RPM

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.7/ondemand-release-web-1.7-1.noarch.rpm

#. Update OnDemand

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo yum clean all
       sudo yum update ondemand

#. Force all PUNs to restart

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo /opt/ood/nginx_stage/sbin/nginx_stage nginx_clean -f

#. Optionally remove old dependencies from prior versions of OOD if they are not used by other applications.

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo yum remove rh-ruby24\* rh-nodejs6\* rh-git29\*

Details
-------

Support running OnDemand with SELinux
.....................................

Beta support for running OnDemand with SELinux has been added. Support is enabled by installing the ``ondemand-selinux`` package. For details see :ref:`ood_selinux`

.. warning::

  If the ``ondemand-selinux`` package was installed from the OnDemand 1.6 release there are several changes that must be addressed manually.  Several SELinux booleans were enabled by the ``ondemand-selinux`` package and are no longer needed by OnDemand. The following SELinux booleans can be disabled if not used outside OnDemand:

  .. code-block:: sh

     sudo setsebool -P httpd_execmem=off
     sudo setsebool -P httpd_unified=off
     sudo setsebool -P httpd_enable_homedirs=off
     sudo setsebool -P httpd_read_user_content=off


Update Passenger and NGINX dependencies
.......................................

Passenger has been upgraded from ``5.3.7`` to ``6.0.4``. NGINX has been upgraded from ``1.14.0`` to ``1.17.3``.


Update Ruby and NodeJS dependencies
...................................

The Ruby version used by OnDemand has been upgraded from ``2.4`` to ``2.5``. The NodeJS version used by OnDemand has been upgraded from ``6`` to ``10``.

Drop EL6 and add EL8 support
............................

OnDemand has dropped support for CentOS/RedHat 6 and added support for CentOS/RedHat 8.


Added the Linux Host Adapter
............................

Support for running jobs directly on Linux hosts has been added. This means interactive 
jobs can now run on a login node instead of through a batch scheduler.

See the documentation for the :ref:`resource-manager-linuxhost`. for more details.

Show account balance warnings
.............................

The dashboard can now show account balance warnings if the users' account balance
is some threshold.

See :ref:`these docs <balance-warnings-on-dashboard>` for more details on how to 
enable this feature.

Job Composer and Active Jobs match Dashboard Branding
.....................................................

The Job Composer and Active Jobs apps' top navigation bar now share the same branding
scheme configured for the dashboard. 

There's no additional configuration required for this other than what's documented 
:ref:`here <branding>`.

Maintenance mode
................

OOD can be put into 'maintenance mode' where it serves a static page to either all
users or a subset (staff on a VPN for example).  This static page informs users
that maintenance is underway while administrators perform disruptive tasks.

See :ref:`these docs <maintenance-mode>` on how to configure and enable this feature.

Titles for Files menu entries
.............................

The shortcuts in the files dropdown menu can now show an optional title along with the 
directory path. The :ref:`original documentation <add-shortcuts-to-files-menu>` on this 
feature has been updated to reflect the new options.


Documentation for Keycloak as identity broker with CILogon
..........................................................

Documentation for Keycloak as identity broker with CILogon has been added in the documentation
entitled ':ref:`authentication-tutorial-oidc-keycloak-rhel7-configure-cilogon`'.
